Artificially keep your GitHub streak going, and going, and going...

Because it's cool to have a long GitHub streak. You know you want to have one.

So giddyup, star and fork it now!

About this Project

Motivation:

Being diligent about slacking off.
As an engineer/entrepreneur--I love automation.
The quote, "Entrepeneurs work 80 hours a week so they can avoid working 40 hours a week."

If the streak fails to run somehow, and your streak is broken, you can create a catchup commit as follows:

./streakify.sh <YYYY-MM-DD>
To manually create a catchup commit:

Make a trivial change to the .streak file
Commit the change
Amend the commit date: git commit --amend --date="$(date -R MMDDhhmm YY)"
